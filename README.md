#### Files:
- train.py: Main code to train the transformer for machine
translation, saving the trained model to transformer.pt.

- test.py: Code to test the pre-trained model on the test set.
Loads the model saved during training.

- encoder.py: Implementation of the encoder class and relevant classes/functions.

- decoder.py: Implementation of the decoder class and relevant classes/functions.

- utils.py: Includes helper functions and classes

- testbleu.txt: Scores for all sentences in the test set, printed
in the format- 'sentence TAB score'.

- Report.pdf: Report containing answers to the theory questions, hyperparameters used to train the models, corresponding graphs, evaluation metrics and analysis of the results.

#### Command to run any of the code files:
> python3 <File_Name>.py
